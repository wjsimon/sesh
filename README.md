A very simple, modern C# wrapper for Microsofts HttpClient, allowing some faster, easier access to Get and Post methods, as well as a simple but effective code generator using this wrapper to automatically create functioning client classes for your server-side controllers in a project/directory of your choosing.

Meant for people who often set up larger server-side controllers, or many of them, and want to reduce manually writing boiler-plate while keeping their code organized.

**These libraries are intended for prototyping use only.**

.NET 9.0+ support only. This is a preview still. If there's anything missing which you'd like to see, feel free to open an issue or send me a message.

The current master is available as pre-built DLLs here: [build.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19150109/build.zip).
If you wish to only use the wrapper, you do not need to reference the included generator .dll.
