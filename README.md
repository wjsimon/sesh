A very simple C# wrapper for Microsofts HttpClient, allowing some faster, easier access to Get and Post methods, as well as a simple but effective code generator using this wrapper to automatically create functioning api calls for your controllers in a project/directory of your choosing.

Meant for people who often set up larger server-side controllers, or many of them, and want to reduce boiler-plate while keeping their code organized.

**These libraries are intended for prototyping use only.**

.NET 9.0+ support only. This is a preview still. If there's anything missing which you'd like to see, feel free to open an issue or send me a message.
